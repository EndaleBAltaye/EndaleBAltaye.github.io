	  <p style="font-size:90%;"> I have used monthly Apple Stock price (Opening price) from the time period of 2005-03-01 to 2014-06-02.
	  Applied Box-Jenkins, ARIMA(p,d,q), modelling and done forecasting using the model selected. The analysis suggest
	  that at logarithmic scale level, the open price for any selected month is <b>on average</b> equals with the previous month open price. Analysis provided here

	  <h3 style="color:green;font-size:120%;"> Text (Sentence) Classification</h3>
	  <p style="font-size:90%;">  <p>President Obama's 2009 inaugural speech and 2012 Presidential candidate, then Governor Mitt Romney's 
	  campaign speech, transcript version, have been used to do sentence classification.  After I created the corpus and did different text 
	  cleaning procedures on it, I passed it through three algorithms.
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machine (SVM)</a></li> , 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest (RF)</a></li> and 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">Decision Tree(Tree) </a></li>  
	  (Tree) were the one I used to classify a random sentence either to President Obama's or Gov. Mitt Romney's used sentence. I used Precision, 
	  recall and Accuracy to select the model which does a better job in classifying the sentence correctly. Finally, RF became the winner 
	  model with 75 percent accuracy and 85% precision. </p>
	  <p> According to the result I made the following interpretations. Among the total sentences predicted to be in Pres.Obma’s 
	  speech, 85% of them are factually correct. On the other hand, 73 % of Gov Romney’s predicted sentences are factually correct. 
	  95 % of Gov Romney’s sentence are predicted correctly. Whereas, 45% of Pres. Obama’s speech sentences are managed to be predicted correctly. This makes 
it hard to predict President Obama’s sentence than Gov. Romeny's. Need to be remembered that the theme of the speeches were not the same.

	  <h3 style="color:green;font-size:120%;"> Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of USA STATES based on 
	  their Revenue and Expenditure </h3>
	  <p style="font-size:90%;"> <p> This project is based on the <b>State Government Finances: 2013</b> data provided on
	  <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk.html" target="_blank"> data
	  link.</a> The finance data contains around 52 fields or attributes. However, for this study I chose to 
focus on <b>Expenditure Amounts</b> and <b> Revenue Amounts</b> to do Hierarchical Clustering (HC) of States. The amounts 
are in thousands. At the beginning, I have done <b>Hierarchical Clustering  </b> among states by considering both the expenditure 
and revenue amounts. This analysis is followed by doing HC of states by considering only the expenditure amounts and again only considering the revenue amounts.
 The three analysis results are summarised below. </p>
<br>
<table style="width:100%">
<thead><tr><th></th><th scope=col>By Expenditure Amount</th><th scope=col>By Revenue Amount</th><th scope=col>By Revenue Expenditure Amount</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
	<tr><th scope=row>Cluster_1</th><td>California State</td><td>California State</td><td>California State</td></tr>
	<tr><th scope=row>Cluster_2</th><td>New York State</td><td>New York State</td><td>New York State</td></tr>
	<tr><th scope=row>Cluster_3</th><td>Texas State</td><td>Texas State and Florida</td><td>Texas State</td></tr>
	<tr><th scope=row>Cluster_4</th><td>Illinois, Massachusetts,Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio States</td><td>
	Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, New Jersey,Illinois,Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania states</td><td>
	Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Florida</td></tr>
	<tr><th scope=row>Cluster_5</th><td>Other States</td><td>Other States</td><td>Other States</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>
As we can clearly see from the three studies, <b> State of California</b> and <b>State of New York </b> are the two 
states with way different from each other and way unequal from other states in both revenue and
 expenditure amounts. When we look at the case for <b>State of Texas </b>, only focusing on expenditure 
 or a combination of expenditure and revenue amounts, it stood alone. However, when we look at the cluster analysis considering only revenue amounts, 
 State of Texas's revenue is significantly equal with State of Florida. From the fourth cluster we can see that 
 the state of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan are significantly equal in revenue and expenditure amounts. Interestingly,
 significant number of states are on cluster 5 which implies that these state's Expenditure and Revenue amount is not as 
 significantly different as initially listed once. Of course, we can slice cluster 5 down but it might not be that significant.  </p>

	  <p style="font-size:90%;"> 
	  Multivariate multiple linear regression is an analysis when we have several y’s (response variables) and several 
	  x’s (predictor variables) in a regression setting. Multivariate refers to the dependent variables and multiple pertains 
	  to the independent variables. </code>. Detail analysis and important assumption checks is provided here.<a href="MultivariateRegressionF.html">Multivariate Multiple
