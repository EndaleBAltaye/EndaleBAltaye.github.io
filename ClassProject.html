	  <p style="font-size:90%;"> 
	  Multivariate multiple linear regression: several y’s and several x’s. Multivariate refers to the dependent 
	  variables and multiple pertains to the independent variables.
	  Note that, for public use purpose variables renamed deliberately to <code> Y1,Y2,Y3 and X1, ...,X16.</code>. Analysis provided here.

	  <p style="font-size:90%;"> 
	  I have used monthly Apple Stock price (Opening price) from the time period of 2005-03-01 to 2014-06-02.
	  Applied Box-Jenkins, ARIMA(p,d,q), modelling and done forecasting using the model selected. The analysis suggest
	  that at logarithmic scale level, the open price for any selected month is <b>on average</b> equals with the previous month open price. Analysis provided here

	  <h3 style="color:green;font-size:120%;"> Text (Sentence) Classification</h3>
   <p style="font-size:90%;"> 
	  President Obama's 2009 inaugural speech and 2012 Presidential candidate, then Governor Mitt Romney's 
	  campaign speech, transcript version, have been used to do sentence classification.  After I created the corpus and did different text 
	  cleaning procedures on it, I passed it through three algorithms.
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machine (SVM)</a> , 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest (RF)</a> and 
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">Decision Tree(Tree) </a>
	  (Tree) were the one I used to classify a random sentence either to President Obama's or Gov. Mitt Romney's used sentence. I used Precision, 
	  recall and Accuracy to select the model which does a better job in classifying the sentence correctly. Finally, RF became the winner 
	  model with 75 percent accuracy and 85% precision.
	</p>
    <br>
   <p style="font-size:90%;"> 
	  According to the result I made the following interpretations. Among the total sentences predicted to be in Pres.Obma’s 
	  speech, 85% of them are factually correct. On the other hand, 73 % of Gov Romney’s predicted sentences are factually correct. 
	  95 % of Gov Romney’s sentence are predicted correctly. Whereas, 45% of Pres. Obama’s speech sentences are managed to be predicted correctly. This makes 
          it hard to predict President Obama’s sentence than Gov. Romeny's. Need to be remembered that the theme of the speeches were not the same.
